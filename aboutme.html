Hi! 
My name is Eda Akaltun. Iâ€™m currently a first year MSc Building Technology student at TU Delft and in the meantime active in the Solar Decathlon team of TU Delft as a Climate Systems engineer & contest champion for ventilation. 

I am very enthusiastic about the digitalization of the construction sector, and I also love challenging myself through tackling complex projects. 

The impact that I wish to make with my provision, is to benefit others positively. Therefore, I find sustainability, charity, and healing architecture very important. 

In my free time I love spending time on coding, gaming and graphic design. Or I simply chase my curiosity and find myself doing all sorts of different things such as: woodworking, cultivating, learning about psychology, map design, digital art and even app building.
